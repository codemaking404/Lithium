Getting Started with .lit Files in Lithium

A .lit file is a Lithium script. It is just a plain text file that contains commands for Lithium to run automatically. Think of it like a batch file, but for Lithium.

Creating a .lit File

Open Notepad (or any text editor).

Save the file as test.lit (make sure the extension is .lit, not .txt).
In Notepad’s Save As dialog:
File name: "test.lit" (use quotes to force .lit)
Save as type: All Files

Writing Your First Script

Inside your .lit file, write Lithium commands exactly like you would type them in the console. For example:

note Hello, this is my first Lithium script!
note I can save notes into the console.
time
random 1 10

What this script does:

Saves two notes.

Prints the current time.

Generates a random number between 1 and 10.

Running Your Script

Method 1: From inside Lithium

Open Lithium Console.

Type:
run test.lit

Method 2: From command line (if using Lithium.exe)
Lithium.exe test.lit

Adding More Commands

Some useful commands you can include:
colors lime black changes console colors
vars shows all stored variables
website https://example.com
 opens a website
list:start ... list:end groups multiple commands
[chain_start] ... [chain_end_loop_number=3] repeats commands

Example:

colors lime black
note Running a loop!
[chain_start]
random 1 5
[chain_end_loop_number=3]

This will generate 3 random numbers.

Tips

Lines starting with # are comments.

Keep your .lit files in the same folder as Lithium, or provide a full path.

Use help <command> inside Lithium to see details for each command.

Congratulations! You just made your first Lithium script.
